# Wireframe
## An introductory class to HTML, CSS, Javascript, & the Web

Wireframe is a program hosted by HackCville, a non-profit entrepreneurial talent accelerator in Charlottesville, Virginia. Wireframe meets twice each week for 2 hours for 9 weeks, and is designed to introduce students with no web design or development experience to the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and how the web works. This repo contains all of the project files and materials for the 18 classes. 

This curriculum has been developed by Daniel Willson, Jessica Zimmerman, Daniel Autry, and Anna Kuno.

If you're following this curriculum on your own, here's a few notes about the structure. Every class's files have two sub-folders: start and final. The start is the files you should start with -- this is what we would give students in-person. 

The final files are what you should end up with. You'll often need to open the index.html final file in Chrome to see what you need to make. Look at the code of the final files only if you're stuck and Googling hasn't worked out. Otherwise you won't learn as much. :)
