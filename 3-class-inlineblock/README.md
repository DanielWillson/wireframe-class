# Class 3 of Wireframe: Introducing the Display Property
## 

Read up online on the "display" CSS property. There are 3 values that you'll use the most: inline, block, and inline-block. Inline-block is what you'll need for this assignment in order to make this grid work properly. 

When you're ready, start with the starter file. Your goal is to make something that looks close to the goal screenshot. Try not to look at the final code unless you're really stuck. 

You will also have to look up some new CSS properties you haven't used before in order to make all of this work. Google is your friend :)
