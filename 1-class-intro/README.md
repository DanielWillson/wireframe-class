# Class 1 of Wireframe: Introduction to HTML Tags + CSS
## 

Before starting with the code in this repository, go through all of the General Assembly Dash tutorials. I've been told they only work in Chrome, FYI.

Then, read over and use this tutorial. Instead of Notepad, use the app called Sublime Text. It has an unlimited free trial. You can download it online, just Google it!

That guide has several pages -- go through and including the HTML Elements page. 

Then, go over this guide to CSS. This guide also has several pages -- go through and including the CSS borders page before stopping. Use this guide to style your HTML file you made for the guide above. 

Once you've done this, you're going to move to the code in this repository. Start with the start file and try to make it into the end file. The end file is an example of what you want to try to make: a basic webpage with headings, images, paragraphs, links, and bullet points.
