# Class 6 of Wireframe: Introduction to Media Queries
## 

Read up online on responsive web design. Read a couple of articles until you generally feel like you know what's going on. 

All websites created today are expected to be responsive. It is not optional. 

Your starter file is a website that looks fine on the desktop but breaks on mobile. 

Use media queries (Google is your friend) to make this site responsive. Feel free to peek at the final CSS in order to get a handle on how to do this.
