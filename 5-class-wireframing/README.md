# Class 5 of Wireframe: Wireframing Practice
## 

Your goal this time is to practice wireframing before you write code. 

Take a look at the wireframe-sample.png image and next to the *final* HTML file in Chrome. Using the sample as a model, draw out on a sheet of paper the wireframe of the entire final site you're trying to make. 

Once you've done that, compare it to the final wireframe-final.png image and see how you did. Small discrepancies are okay -- there is more than one way to do this. 

Once you've done that, actually code the site!
