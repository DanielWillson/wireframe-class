	<h1>HTML & CSS Extras</h1>

	<h2>First, please fill out this attendance sheet, and complete a few surveys.</h2>
	<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuvaFClFPuGiq1AAwEohnYC3rQ-DBLGzlJQj_ZiCY3s/edit" target="_blank">Attendance Sheet</a></p>

	<h2>Our first extra is going to be about floats, a useful layout tool.</h2>
	<p><a href="demo.html" target="_blank">This webpage</a> has a bunch of challenges I want you to work on with the person next to you. Both of you should code everything. Don't move on until your partner understands what's going on.</p>

	<h2>Next, I'm going to do a few demos for everyone.</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>FileZilla Site Manager</li>
		<li>How multiple files work</li>
		<li>IDs vs Classes</li>
		<li>Children vs parents</li>
		<li>Display: none & visibility: hidden</li>
		<li>Browser testing - <a href="https://www.browserling.com/" target="_blank">Browserling</a></li>
		<li>The hr and br tag</li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<h2>One more challenge!</h2>
	<p>There are a lot of ways you can select elements on a page to edit with CSS. <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/" target="_blank">This game</a> helps you practice them. It gets really advanced, but the first half or so you should be able to get under your belt. Work on this together with someone next to you.</p>
