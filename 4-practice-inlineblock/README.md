# Class 4 of Wireframe: Practicing the Display Property
## 

Your goal with this project is to practice using inline-block to make grids. 

Keep in mind that the width of divs can be percentage values. Margins and padding can be, too.

Read up online on the "CSS box model" until you've got the differences between width, padding, border, and margin down and how they all interact. That will help a lot here. 

You may find it helpful to sketch out a wireframe of how the different elements in the final site are displayed before you get going. That can be a helpful way to organize your code.
